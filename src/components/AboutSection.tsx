        This website is dedicated to sharing the wisdom of Kabir, a 15th-century
        Indian mystic poet and saint. His poetry, known as Dohas, consists of
        couplets that convey deep philosophical and spiritual messages. Our goal
        is to help spread Kabir'''s teachings to a wider audience, making his
        wisdom accessible to all.
